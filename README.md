Basic program that writes and reads a .txt file. 

Pointers cheat sheet:

A pointer is a container that stores a memory location

int n = 5;

&n - returned the address of the variable n

int* ptr = &n

To access the value at the address, must de-reference the pointer. 

*ptr : * and then name means 'Please access data at this memory location'
